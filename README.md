# React Sales Web App

This web app has been created using `create-react-app` command of React library. The app shows a list of books that a user can potentialy purchase with title, author and price of the books. By clicking on the elements of the list the user will be able to see their total cost increasing (or decreasing in case the user click again on an already clicked element).
Everything has been styled using some basic CSS with hover and transitions effects.

The logic behind the app works using `setState` to change the `state` of the Constructor that manages the maths into the functions.

## How to start

After you forked this repo run npm start on your terminal and the app will be executed in your http://localhost:3000 on your browser.
